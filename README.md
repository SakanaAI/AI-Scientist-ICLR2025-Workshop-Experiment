A paper produced by [The AI Scientist](https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/) passed a peer-review process at a workshop in a top machine learning conference. To our knowledge, this is the first fully AI-generated paper that has passed the same peer-review process that human scientists go through.

The paper was generated by an improved version of the original AI Scientist. We will be sharing full details of The AI Scientist-v2 in an upcoming blog and paper. This paper was submitted to the ICLR 2025 [Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/icbinb-2025) titled “I Can't Believe It's Not Better: Challenges in Applied Deep Learning”. The workshop is hosted at ICLR, one of the premier conferences in machine learning, like NeurIPS and ICML.

We conducted this research with the full cooperation of both the ICLR leadership and the organizers of this ICLR workshop. We thank all of them for supporting this research into how AI-generated papers fare in peer-review. We also received an institutional review board (IRB) approval for this research from the University of British Columbia.
